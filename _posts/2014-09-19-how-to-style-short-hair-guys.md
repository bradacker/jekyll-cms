Then, you can look best with versatile hairstyles and be flattering at the same time.

It is important that you should know how and what products to be used for different kinds of hair.

Rather than trying hair products at home and be an embarrassment, it is advised to go to a good hair stylist initially. Shampoo, conditioner, serum or cream, pomade, wax, and balm are a list of hair products that will be handy.<!--more-->

Apart from your hair texture and volume, your facial structure has a role to play in hair styling. A professional hair stylist can suggest which style suits you better according to the shape of your face like oval, round, flat, etc. Hairstyling is generally a simple two-step process where you apply the product to the hair first, followed by styling with hands or by using hairdressers.

### Tips on how to style short hair for men:

  1. Spread the hair product evenly over your hands and apply it throughout the hair. Don’t try and style it now.
  2. After applying the product, maneuver the hair to match a particular hairstyle.
  3. In a case of thick hair, it could involve little more cream or paste than usual. Unless you can look natural with less product but always start with less and work your way up.
  4. If you feel the hair gel or cream is heavy on your hair, use a hot blow dryer to dry the heavier sections. It melts the gel and can style your hair in a different way for a new look.
  5. Use quality products to do hairstyles for short straight black hair as cheaper ones could end giving undesired look.

Hairstyles change with trends or fads. You can look up to your favorite movie star or professional athlete and just mold it into a similar hairdo.

### Let’s look at some specific hairstyles for short straight black hair:

  * With a heavy volume of short black hair, it’s good to have little facial hair too. It will give a complete look for any hairstyle.
  * For silky texture hair, part the hair with hands after shampoo. Then, use a <a title="Electric Straightening Comb 101" href="http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/electric-straightening-comb-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large tooth comb</a> and a paddle brush to smooth finish the hair.
