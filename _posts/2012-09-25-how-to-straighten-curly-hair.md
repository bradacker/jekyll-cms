</p>

### Tools Needed to Get Straight Hair

  * Shampoo
  * Conditioner
  * Hair Dryer with Diffuser
  * Flat Iron
  * Wide-Toothed Comb
  * Hair Brush
  * Heat Protection Spray
  * Hair Serum

## How to Straighten Curly Hair &#8211; What You Need to Do:

### 1. Get a Good Washing In

Before you straighten your hair, you should wash it well. Clean and fresh hair will be easier to straighten and you won&#8217;t need to deal with grease. Try to use shampoo and conditioner that will help keep your hair from becoming damaged since you&#8217;ll be using a blow dryer and flat iron most of the time that you straighten your hair.

I&#8217;ve always found that TRESemme Thermal Recovery is shampoo and conditioner work best. It&#8217;s not very expensive and it will keep your ends from becoming dry and damaged.

Wash your hair, very well! Massage your scalp with the shampoo and conditioner and be sure that you thoroughly rinse out all of the shampoo and conditioner! You don&#8217;t want flakes or dry scalp. The instructions on your shampoo will tell you how to wash your hair best. Some shampoos have different directions, it really depends on the type of shampoo you are using.

### 2. Comb Out Tangles

Use your wide-toothed comb and run it through all areas of your hair. A brush will work fine but a comb with get out more tangles and it will help get the part your want in your hair much easier. You should always part your hair while it is wet. If you wait and do it after it&#8217;s dry, you won&#8217;t get the part you desire.

### 3. Dry Your Hair

Some people don&#8217;t enjoy using blow dryers as the heat can cause thermal damage. However, if you use a diffuser with your blow dryer, it can lessen the damage to your hair due to the fact that it&#8217;s spreading the heat around your head rather than just blowing on one area of your head.

Blow drying your hair doesn&#8217;t need to be bad for it if you have the right tools! If you feel that you want to always wait for your hair to dry naturally, that is fine. However many women who have curly hair find that it takes hours for their hair to dry which you may not have to spare.

You should never attempt to use your flat iron if your hair is wet, even if it&#8217;s only slightly wet. This is VERY dangerous for your hair and will cause damage to it more quickly than just about anything else you do to your hair. Even if you have a Wet2Straight flat iron, you should still dry your hair before straightening.

While you are blow-drying your hair, use your brush and run it down the areas you are drying. This will help straighten your hair a little so that you don&#8217;t have to use your flat iron as much later on.

### 4. Straighten Your Hair!

Use a flat iron to straighten your hair. You&#8217;ll find that the <a title="How to Find the Best Hair Straightening Products" href="http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/best-hair-straightening-products/" target="_blank">best hair straightening brands</a> are Chi, Remington, Solia, Sedu, Babyliss, Hai and Paul Mitchell. Yes, many of these are a bit expensive but they only cost this much because they are worth it! You will easily be able to get your hair straightened with one of the flat iron brands listed above.

  * Straightening your hair with a flat iron is very simple. Again, make sure your hair is completely dry before you start. Let your flat iron heat up to the suggested heat of the instructions for your hair type.
  * You want to ensure that you get every area of your hair straight. To do this, you&#8217;ll need to straighten your hair &#8220;in layers.&#8221; All you need to do is take the top half of your hair and put it up in a bun on the top of your head. Clipping it up will help keep it secure so it doesn&#8217;t fall down and mix in with what you are trying to straighten at the time.

What is left down, the under half of your hair, should be divided into about 1/2 inch thick pieces. This is how much you should be straightening at one time, it&#8217;s the safest amount and it will ensure that all of it actually gets straightened. Go over that section as many times as it takes to get it straight. After you straighten that section, run your brush or comb through it.

  * Don&#8217;t leave your straightener on one area of your hair for more than a second at a time. This will leave strange creases in your hair that you surely won&#8217;t like and they are very difficult to get out. You will most likely see smoke or steam when pull the straightener off of your hair and that is okay. It doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s hurting your hair, the only way you should stop straightening your hair is if you hear your hair start to sizzle.
  * As you go through the rest of your hair, continue to brush it so you can remove tangles. Once you are finished, be sure that you got all of your hair straight! It will drive you crazy later if you notice that you missed a spot and you can&#8217;t fix it.

### 5. Use Your Heat Protection Spray!

After you feel your hair is completely straight, spray your hair with your heat protection spray. There is also heat protection cream as well, but sprays tend to work the best. Heat protection spray will ensure that the heat from your straightener doesn&#8217;t cause as many split ends or dryness.

Many say that Nexxus Heat Protexx Heat Protection is one of the best thermal protection sprays there is. Many people also use TRESemme Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray works very well also and it&#8217;s cheaper than most other heat protection sprays.
