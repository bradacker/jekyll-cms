If you want to know how to permanently straighten hair then read on to understand all about chemical straightening. If you are tired of using straighteners every morning or find that you hair is just out of control, then permanently straightening it could be the solution that you are looking for.</span>

When learning how to permanently straighten hair you need to understand that just like adding a permanent wave to you hair, the effects are actually not permanent. You hair will stay straight and will not be affected by the rain or moisture in the air like before, but of course it will continue to grow curly at the roots; so just like covering over your grey hairs every few weeks, if you want dead straight hair then it is a process that you will have to be prepared to repeat.

Chemically straightening your hair will leave it totally wave free, and it will become manageable and shinier too. However, just like adding a permanent wave to your hair, too many applications can cause damage to you hair. So, before you go about straightening your hair, read on below to understand just how the process works and what to expect.

When learning to straighten hair you should realize that there are different processes available of different strength as well as a choice of home and salon treatments. Indeed, not all hair should be straightened in this manner; badly damaged hair simply breaks under the stress.

Unless you are confident about using chemicals at home or have successfully treated your hair in the past, always visit your local salon for a consultation first. A hairdresser will be able to assess not just the condition of your hair, but the thickness and wave of each strand; from these findings he can decide whether or not you are suitable or not for chemical straightening.

The treated hair will stay permanently smoother after treatment, but you will need to repeat the process on your new hair growth every few months. How often you repeat the process will depend on how curly you hair is naturally and how quickly it grows. You must be careful however to only treat the new growth of hair, constantly adding chemicals to your hair being a recipe for brittle and dull looking locks.

The professional name for the process can vary, and when learning how to permanently straighten hair you should look out for &#8220;straight perms&#8221; or &#8220;hair relaxing&#8221; offered by your local salon. Straightening your hair is a delicate process and one that can damage your hair if too many chemicals are used or are kept on your head for too long; so find a professional who is trained in straight perms.

To permanently straighten your tresses, a combination of chemicals and a heat treatment will be required. Chemicals will be added to your hair and <a title="Electric Straightening Comb 101" href="http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/electric-straightening-comb-101/" target="_blank">straightening irons</a> will be applied to the hair to iron out the curls and waves. The chemicals used are designed to protect your hair and relax it at the same time, although repeated straightening will damage your hair.

The formulation of the chemicals used to straighten hair includes collagen and keratin proteins, minerals and silk extracts. For hair that has been previously damaged, per-treatments rich in nutrients and proteins are available. Check with your hairdresser to see which treatment she will use before you start; some can be damaging to the hair, stripping it of its natural beauty and shine.

When learning <a href="http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/" target="_blank">how to permanently straighten hair</a> you need to realize that there are risks involved; adding a mixture of chemicals to your hair and scalp will never be free of risk even if you have straightened you hair previously with no negative side effects. Depending on your hair type, a choice of light to strong chemicals will be needed to create the desired effect, sodium hydroxide being used for <a href="http://afrocaribbean.eu/" target="_blank">Afro Caribbean hair</a>.

If you are confident about using a <a title="How to Find the Best Hair Straightening Products" href="http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/best-hair-straightening-products/" target="_blank">home straightening kit</a> then there are some tips that you should follow in order to obtain the very best results. Firstly, apply a generous layer of petroleum jelly to your scalp to protect it from the nasty chemicals you are about to add. If you have sensitive skin then you can also apply to your neck and top of your back.

The kit you use will contain a relaxer cream as well as an activator solution and your next step will be to mix these together. Always use the gloves provided when you are handling chemicals and ensure that you mix thoroughly. You should always cover your shoulders with an old towel to protect both your skin as well as your clothing from the chemicals.

With your hair parted down the middle, divide it into six to eight even sections and start adding the mixture to the already <a title="Get Straight Hair in Less Than 2 Hours" href="http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/get-straight-hair-in-less-than-2-hours/" target="_blank">heat straightened hair</a>. Next, ensure that you leave the solution on for the set amount of time according to your hair type. Never leave on the solution longer in the hope that your hair will become straighter; you will only end up damaging it.

After waiting the required time you will need to rinse your hair and then wash with a neutralizing shampoo followed by a protein rich conditioner. Wash you hair thoroughly to ensure there is no residue and leave the conditioner on for around ten minutes. The proteins in the conditioner will ensure that your newly straightened hair is kept in great condition.

These are the top tips you need to follow on how to permanently straighten your hair. Only ever proceed with a home treatment if you are confident you can complete the task successfully; otherwise consult your hair stylist for professional advice. For first time treatments it is recommended that you visit a salon and once you are happy with your new look you can carry out touch ups on re growth from home.
