Hair relaxers are commonly associated with women. However, there are many men who, due to the curly nature of their hair are unable to achieve sleek, straight hair styles.

Nevertheless, men seldom take any serious action with regard to their personal grooming even though we also have a desire to look good. The absence of effort to improve looks among men, especially when it comes to hair, can be attributed to the misconception that a lot of effort is required to achieve temporary results.

While this may have been true a few years ago, the hair care industry has grown and you can easily find an appropriate hair relaxer for men on the market. Some of the other hair straightening options such as Brazilian hair straightening and thermal hair conditioning are very costly, and the process takes a considerable amount of time.

## How They Work

Hair relaxers have chemicals whose properties enable them to <a title="How to Straighten Curly Hair" href="http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/how-to-straighten-curly-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">straighten curly hair</a> without exposing them to heat. The most common active ingredient for hair relaxers is sodium hydroxide, also known as Lye. However, there is a lot of criticism against the use of Lye and there are many hair relaxing products that do not use Lye as their active ingredient. Calcium hydroxide is the most common no-Lye relaxer that is not as harsh as sodium chloride but helps people achieve the same results.

Generally, the effectiveness of a hair relaxer depends on the PH of the relaxing agent. Higher PH results in <a title="Get Straight Hair in Less Than 2 Hours" href="http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/get-straight-hair-in-less-than-2-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faster straightening</a> but has the potential to damage your hair or scalp.Â Another popular ingredient to look out for among the no-Lye relaxers are Guanine hydroxide. It is only a little less effective than Lye, but it does its job while keeping the hair and scalp healthy.

The thickness of men&#8217;s hair varies from one person to the next one just as with women. It is therefore perfectly normal for one relaxer to be effective on one person and fail miserably on another. This is true among most no Lye relaxers. Shea butter products are a good example a relaxer that is perfect when used on thinner hair but work very slowly on thicker hair. The shea butter complex takes a longer time to relax the hair, but it continually supplies it with lots of minerals during the, process, giving you straight, shiny hair when complete.

## Texturizers

Technically, texturizers are a mild form of a hair relaxing agent. These are recommend for men whose hair is not very curly, but who want to be able to control and tame the frizz and make, the strands more defined. These types of relaxers are a great option for men, and the market is awash with numerous products targeting us. The biggest benefit of texturizers is that you no longer have to worry about protecting the hair of scalp since their action is very mild.

## Shopping Tips

There aren&#8217;t as many hair relaxers for men as there are for women. You have to look at the generic brands available and scrutinize the ingredients before making your purchase. A hair specialist may also provide you with insight on the best product based on your hair&#8217;s texture (this can be determined through a strand test). Some men&#8217;s hair relaxers tend to be harsher, thanks to the thicker hair, and it is, therefore important that you use proper protection, when applying the relaxer to protect your scalp and hair from damage.

A color indicator is another essential component to look for when shopping for a men&#8217;s hair relaxer. This is because it makes it possible to know when all the relaxer has been washed away.

## Conclusion

There is no doubt that hair relaxers are heaven send for men with thick, curly hair. There are many times when you would like to try a different hairstyle that calls for your hair to be straight only to be frustrated by your curly hair. However, with relaxers, it is now possible for anyone to try any kind of hairstyle regardless of the nature of their hair.

Online stores provide a good opportunity for you to choose the right hair relaxer after supplying the right information. What&#8217;s more, there are numerous relaxer brands to choose from and if you are shy, you won&#8217;t have to jostle with (mostly ladies) in the cosmetics section of your local store!
