Learn how to straighten your hair without heat:

Are you trying to find a heat and damage free method to straighten naturally curly hair?

Part your hair and apply L’Occitane’s shea butter or another holding product. Anything else you can do to get your hair straighter without heat, do it before rolling.

With large curlers, roll up your hair as tight and smooth as possible.

Leave in for about an hour and a half or when hair is completely dry.

Remove the curlers as gently as possible.

You should now have straight hair without heat. You could also [try using herbs](http://straighteningnaturalhair.org/herbs-straighten-black-hair/).

Most importantly, this will protect your natural hair.
